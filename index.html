				<h2>The Way You Do Anything is the Way You Do Everything</h2>
				<p>Musashi chose the sword as his “One Thing,” but he used everything he did and studied to deepen his understanding of the sword.</p>
				<p>He better understood the cadence and footwork of a sword fight by fully dedicating himself to the study of dance. He better understood the most efficient and effective ways to swing his sword through deep dedication to the study of paintbrush strokes while painting and doing calligraphy.</p>
				<p>What is your “one thing?” Writing? Music? Engineering? Plumbing? Teaching? Leadership?</p>
				<p>How can you approach everything you do as a way to deepen your understanding and performance of your “one thing?” And, in turn, better understand everything else in life. “If you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.”</p>
				<p>The Way you do anything is the Way you do everything. This includes brushing teeth, listening to your partner, children, or friends, exercising, and doing the dishes. Everything is an opportunity to practice The Way. To be fully present and engaged while remaining equanimous and poised.</p>
